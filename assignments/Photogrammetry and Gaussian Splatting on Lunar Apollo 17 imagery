## Abstract

This project explores the integration of photogrammetric modeling and Gaussian Splatting techniques to process and analyze Apollo 17 lunar imagery.  
- **Part A**: Developed a 3D textured mesh using 15 original Apollo 17 photographs and evaluated view recovery quality using SSIM and PSNR.  
- **Part B**: Generated 10 novel views using Gaussian Splatting, reprocessed the augmented dataset, and compared improvements in model quality.

## Methodology

### Part A: Photogrammetry and Gaussian Splatting â€” Original Views

**Dataset**  
- 15 high-resolution Apollo 17 images.

**Photogrammetry Processing (Agisoft Metashape)**  
1. Imported and aligned all images.
2. Generated a dense point cloud with confidence visualization.
3. Reconstructed a 3D mesh and applied high-resolution textures.

**Gaussian Splatting (Nerfstudio)**  
- Exported images and camera parameters in COLMAP format.
- Prepared data using `ns-process-data colmap`.
- Trained Gaussian Splatting model using `ns-train gaussian-splatting`.
- Rendered original views using `ns-export`.

**Similarity Metrics**  
- Calculated SSIM and PSNR using Python libraries (`scikit-image` and `opencv-python`).

### Part B: Photogrammetry Enhancement Using Gaussian Splatting-Derived Views

**Novel View Generation**  
- Generated 10 new views covering underrepresented areas using the trained Gaussian Splatting model.

**Photogrammetry with Augmented Dataset**  
- Combined the 15 original and 10 new images (total 25).
- Repeated the photogrammetry workflow (alignment, dense cloud, mesh, texture).

**Evaluation**  
- Visual (qualitative) and metric-based (quantitative) comparisons.

## Results

### Part A (Original Views)
- **SSIM**: Average 0.6503.
- **PSNR**: Average 22.41 dB.
- Textured mesh displayed accurate geometry and realistic textures.

### Part B (Augmented Dataset)
- **SSIM**: Improved to 0.858.
- **PSNR**: Increased to 26.52 dB.
- Model showed better surface coverage, fewer gaps, denser mesh, and improved texture continuity.

## Conclusion

The study demonstrated that integrating Gaussian Splatting-derived novel views into the photogrammetric workflow significantly enhances 3D model quality, both structurally and visually. These methods can potentially improve future planetary surface modeling tasks.
